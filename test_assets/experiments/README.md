# Experiment setup from .zip files

Each of the experiments has a compressed (.zip) folder, containing the following files:
- json file with simulation information (timetable)
- BPMN model file
- json file with local and global constraint information (constraints)

The algorithm accepts only certain filenames.

Use the reference below to set the files up correctly. (if you wish to start from the .zip folder)

### JSON files (timetable)
- timetable.json
- timetable_backup.json (COPY of timetable.json)


### BPMN files
- model.bpmn
- model_backup.bpmn


### JSON files (constraints)
- constraints.json
- constraints_backup.json (COPY of constraints.json)
